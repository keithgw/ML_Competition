## Reproduce Training Steps

1. Download data and unzip from http://orwell.uncc.edu/6156/project.tar Can only be accessed from within UNCC network.

2. Find empty data files in training data  
    * findEmpty.py
	* remove corresponding labels from train.csv
	
3. Process training images
	* Resize each image to the modal image size. This will distort some of the images, but will allow for consistent data size representation.  
	* Convert images to RBG matrices	
		* train.py
		
4. Train Classifier
